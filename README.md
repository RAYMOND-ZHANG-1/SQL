# RockBuster Data Analysis Project
Analysis of the PostgreSQL Sample Database of a ficticous DVD rental company by using SQL.
# Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Your job is to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service.
# Data
The dataset comes from an postgreSQL opensource for practicing purpose only.
# Result
Asia region plays an important role in our
customer list. They hold 5 positions in top 10
countries.
Comedy film inventory should increase as it
was top 5 revenue gained but last top 5
inventory number.
Customers normally return the film back in 5
days which is close to our longest rental
duration 7days. Thatâ€™s a good signal to us.
Perhaps, we would be able to increase the
rental days around 10 days.
